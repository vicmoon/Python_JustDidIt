The idea for "Just Did It" came to me in a moment when I was looking for ways to build a specific skill. I needed to keep myself on track. 
So, first it was a piece of paper that I hang on a wall. Every day, when I would do the activity, I would cross a day. 
There was something attractive in that neat row of crossed days. I felt like I was going somewhere, using time with a purpose. 

Now, a couple of years later was talking a course in web developement. One advise from the teacher, as to how to stay concentrated and keep learning even if the subject to study is pretty complex, was to keep track, be persistent. Basically the idea is that you need to learn or practice something every day in order to improve.

I called it it "Just did it"  to express the joy of having accomplished something :)
